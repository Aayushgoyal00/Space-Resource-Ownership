## Introduction

The concept of private ownership in outer space is evolving as space exploration and commercial activities expand. With advancements in technology, private entities are increasingly interested in claiming and managing extraterrestrial resources.

Our project proposes a system where individuals and private organizations can claim extraterrestrial land, sell the land and manage transaction of resources through auctions
